# Minimizing-Churn-Rate-Through-Analysis-of-Financial-Habits

---Overview
Objective: Analyze financial habits to predict user churn and reduce cancellation rates.
Methodology: Utilize machine learning models and data analysis techniques to gain insights into user behavior.

---Business Challenge
Goal: Identify users likely to cancel their subscriptions.
Outcome: Build targeted features to boost engagement and retain users.

-Project Workflow:-
---Data Exploration and Visualization
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Visualized trends and patterns in user financial habits to identify potential indicators of churn.

---Data Manipulation:-
Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, cleaning, and formatting.
Transformed raw data into meaningful features relevant to churn prediction.

---Model Building:-
Employed classification models from Scikit-learn:
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Trees
-Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-Trained and tested each model to evaluate classification accuracy.

---Model Tuning and Validation
Applied K-Fold Cross Validation for performance assessment and overfitting prevention.
Used Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model configurations.
Implemented feature selection algorithms to identify significant predictors and reduce complexity.

---Key Findings
-User Behavior Patterns:
Spikes or reductions in spending are strong churn predictors.
Inconsistent financial behavior correlates with higher cancellation likelihood.

---Model Performance:
- Logistic Regression yielded the best performance, offering interpretability and predictive power.
---Feature Importance:
-Frequent small withdrawals and large transactions during specific periods are key churn indicators.

---Conclusion
-Successfully predicted churn with high accuracy through financial habit analysis.
-Insights can guide feature development to enhance user engagement, reduce churn rates, and improve retention.
